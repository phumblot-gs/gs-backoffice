# Sandbox Tools — running commands (and Claude) in a Fly Sprite as _tools_, not an _environment_

> Status: **design (2026-06-21, revised). Not yet built.** Goal: give the governance agents an isolated, reusable **Fly Sprite microVM** they can drive as **tools** — the general primitive is `sandbox_run` (execute any command in the sandbox at a given git ref and capture the result); `sandbox_code_task` is sugar on top for the engineer agent (run Claude → edit → commit → **push from inside the sandbox**). The same primitive lets **verification agents** (the independent auditor, acceptance-criteria controllers) run scanners, pentest tools and functional tests — in their **own** sandbox checked out at the pushed commit, for trustworthy, independent verification. All without depending on Paperclip's sandbox _environment_ machinery. Packaged as a **self-contained plugin** so it stays isolated and is cleanly removable if/when Paperclip ships native E2B that matches this need.

## 1. Why a tool, not an environment driver

We first integrated Fly Sprites as a Paperclip **sandbox environment driver** (`packages/sandbox-fly-sprites`). That makes the _agent run itself_ execute "on" the sandbox, which drags in Paperclip's whole remote-workspace machinery — and every layer of that machinery fought the immature `@fly/sprites` 0.0.1 transport. The root realisation: **we don't want the agent to run in the sandbox; we want the agent to _send a task to_ the sandbox.** Modelling the sandbox as a **tool** the agent calls (agent stays on Local) sidesteps the entire problem class.

| Problem hit with the environment-driver approach                     | Cause                                                                                       | Status with the tool approach                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stdin not forwarded → `claude` never got its prompt → `process_lost` | SDK `execFile` can't send stdin                                                             | reused fix (spawn + StdinEOF) — see [#55]                                                 |

| `process_lost` mid-run                                               | redirect silences the WS → Paperclip's liveness watchdog kills the in-sandbox agent process | **gone** — the agent runs on Local; nothing watches a process _inside_ the Sprite         |
| retry fell back to Local                                             | recovery re-resolves the env                                                                | **moot** — no Paperclip sandbox _run_ happens (env-driver patch [#57] no longer triggers) |
| orphaned Sprite kept running                                         | Paperclip's bridge daemon not killed + `reuseLease` never deletes                           | **we own the lifecycle** in the tool                                                      |
| no git-native workspace                                              | sync strategy hard-coded by driver in Paperclip 2026.609.0                                  | **bypassed** — git clone/push happens inside the Sprite, Paperclip never syncs files      |

What carries over: the **reliable Sprite transport** we built and validated ([#55] stdin, [#56] chunked exec) and the `@fly/sprites` client wiring move from the env driver into the tool. What becomes unused: the **environment driver** itself and the Paperclip retry-env patch ([#57]) — to be retired once the tool replaces it.

## 2. The shape of it

Agents run normally (Local, `claude_local`) and call the sandbox **tools** to offload work to an isolated microVM: the engineer offloads a **coding task** (`sandbox_code_task`); verification agents offload **scans/tests** (`sandbox_run`). Each gets a structured result and uses its **GitHub tools** to inspect the diff/PR. The diagram below shows the engineer's code-iteration loop; verification is the same primitive (`sandbox_run`) in a separate sandbox at the pushed commit (see §4, §6).

```
Methods Officer / sub-agent (runs on Local)
        │
        │  tool call: sandbox_code_task({ sandboxKey, repo, baseBranch, targetBranch, task })
        ▼
  ┌───────────────────────────── plugin tool (runs in the Paperclip worker) ─────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. resolve Sprite for `sandboxKey`  → create (git clone) | reuse (git fetch + checkout)              │
  │  2. inject GitHub token + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for the duration of the exec only                          │
  │  3. run `claude -p "<task>" --output-format json` inside the Sprite (reliable transport)               │
  │  4. claude edits → commit → push `targetBranch`                                                         │
  │  5. capture { branch, headSha, pushed, prUrl?, summary, costUsd } and return it                        │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │  result
        ▼
Methods Officer / sub-agent  → reviews the diff via GitHub MCP tools (compare/PR files)
        │
        ├─ satisfied → open/finish PR, hand to the governance gate
        └─ needs changes → call sandbox_code_task again with the SAME `sandboxKey`
                           (same Sprite, woken from cold; `git pull`; claude iterates)
```

The Sprite is **stateful and reusable across calls**: the agent and the sandbox have a conversation across multiple tool invocations, which is exactly the "invoke → review → re-invoke in the same sandbox" loop.

## 3. Tools (draft)

The capability is a small family of tools over one shared Sprite lifecycle. **`sandbox_run` is the primitive**; everything else is built on it.

### 3a. `sandbox_run` — the primitive (any command)

Execute an arbitrary command in a sandbox checked out at a given git ref, and return the result. This is what **verification agents** use: code scanners (`semgrep`, `trivy`), pentest tools, functional tests (`pnpm test`), lint, build — anything.

Input: `sandboxKey`, `repoUrl`, `ref` (branch or commit SHA to check out), `command`, `timeoutMs` (opt), `credMode` (opt: `read_only` default | `push`), `artifacts` (opt: paths to capture back, e.g. a SARIF report). Output: `{ sandboxKey, spriteName, ref, exitCode, stdout, stderr, artifacts?, durationMs }`. Large outputs/reports are captured via the reliable chunked transport ([#56]); big files are read back from the sandbox rather than streamed.

`sandbox_code_task` is then **sugar**: `sandbox_run` with `command = claude -p "<task>"` (+ `acceptEdits`) followed by `git add/commit/push` — i.e. the same primitive plus the git wrapper and a parsed Claude result.

### 3b. `sandbox_code_task` — engineer convenience (Claude edits + pushes)

Input:

| Field             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sandboxKey`      | Stable id scoping Sprite reuse. Must be tied to the **repo** (e.g. `proj-<projectId>`, since each project has its own repo) so a reused Sprite always matches its clone. Same key → same Sprite.                                                               |
| `repoUrl`         | Git URL to clone on first use. **Resolved per project** — it varies from one project to another and may even change over time for the same project; never hard-coded. The caller (the engineer sub-agent / Methods Officer) passes the current project's repo. |
| `baseBranch`      | Branch to start from (default repo default).                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `targetBranch`    | Branch the agent's work is committed/pushed to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `task`            | The instruction handed to `claude -p` inside the Sprite.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `model` (opt)     | Claude model for the in-sandbox run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `timeoutMs` (opt) | Hard cap for the in-sandbox run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Output (structured):

| Field                           | Meaning                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `sandboxKey`, `spriteName`      | Which sandbox handled it (for traceability + reuse). |
| `branch`, `headSha`, `pushed`   | What landed on GitHub.                               |
| `prUrl` (opt)                   | If the tool also opens/updates a PR.                 |
| `summary`                       | Claude's own synthesis of what it did.               |
| `result`, `costUsd`, `exitCode` | Raw outcome + telemetry.                             |
| `logRef` (opt)                  | Pointer to the full in-sandbox transcript for audit. |

The tool is **idempotent-ish per call** (each call is one bounded Claude turn that ends by pushing). Long-running concerns (a turn that exceeds `timeoutMs`) end the call with a partial result rather than hanging.

## 4. Sprite lifecycle (the cold/cheap reuse model)

Fly Sprites auto-hibernate: `running → warm → cold` when idle; an exec wakes a cold Sprite; the disk persists; a cold (stopped) Sprite bills storage only, not CPU/RAM. So the intended model is **provision once, reuse warm/cold**:

- **First call for a `sandboxKey`**: create the Sprite, `git clone` the (per-project) `repoUrl`, (optionally) provision toolchain (e.g. `pnpm` — missing from the base image; install once).
- **Subsequent calls (same key)**: the Sprite is cold (≈ free) → exec wakes it → `git fetch` + checkout/reset → `claude` iterates → push. No re-clone; fast.
- **Repo-match guard**: because `repoUrl` is per-project and can change, on reuse the tool verifies the Sprite's existing clone `origin` matches the call's `repoUrl`. On mismatch (wrong/changed repo) it re-clones fresh (or provisions a new Sprite) rather than fetching the wrong repository. Keying `sandboxKey` to the project keeps this an edge case (repo URL changed for the project), not the norm.
- **Isolation by key/role**: distinct `sandboxKey`s ⇒ distinct Sprites ⇒ **concurrent tasks/tickets never share a sandbox**. The key is scoped by **role/intent**, not just by project: the engineer iterates in e.g. `eng-<issue>`, while a **verification agent uses its own** e.g. `audit-<issue>`. This is the per-ticket isolation requirement, made explicit and owned by the tool (vs Paperclip's `reuse_by_environment` which shared one Sprite per environment).
- **Verifier independence (integrity)**: an auditor / acceptance-criteria controller must NOT run in the engineer's working sandbox (which may hold uncommitted or arranged state). It opens its **own fresh sandbox checked out at the exact pushed commit/branch** and runs its scans/tests against **what is in git** — with **read-only** credentials (`credMode: read_only`, clone only, no push). Independent sandbox + least-privilege creds = trustworthy verification.
- **Cleanup (destroy)**: `deleteSprite` is **permanent** (Sprite + disk gone). It is **safe** — the durable artifact is the GitHub push; the Sprite is a disposable cache, recreatable at any commit. Triggered two ways: (1) **`sandbox_release(sandboxKey)`** explicitly when the work is terminal (PR merged / issue closed / verification done) — the primary teardown; (2) a **periodic idle reaper** as a backstop, deleting Sprites idle (no exec) beyond a **7-day default TTL (configurable)**. 7 days comfortably survives a multi-day human review/merge gate while reclaiming abandoned sandboxes; healthy flows release explicitly so the reaper rarely fires. (The orphaned-running-Sprite bug cannot recur: there is no bridge daemon — we never start one.)
- **No artifact trimming**: we deliberately do **not** clean builds/`node_modules`/test outputs before parking a Sprite cold (kept simple — the gain is marginal since destroy loses no work). Cold storage cost is bounded by destroy-on-terminal + the reaper; toolchain lives in the image/checkpoint, not the per-sandbox disk.

Checkpoints (`createCheckpoint`/`restoreCheckpoint` in the SDK) are an optional optimisation: snapshot a freshly-cloned+provisioned Sprite and restore it to spin up sibling sandboxes instantly. Out of scope for the spike.

## 5. Secrets & credentials (how the worker gets its tokens)

**Constraint discovered in 2026.609.0**: a plugin _tool_ has no usable secret path — `ctx.secrets.resolve()` is hard-disabled (throws), and `ctx.config.get()` returns the raw, unresolved config. Only _environment driver_ config gets host-side secret resolution (how the legacy env driver gets its Sprites token). So the sandbox tools take secrets from the **worker env passthrough** instead: tokens are injected into the Paperclip container by **Terraform** (`SPRITES_TOKEN`, `SANDBOX_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and forwarded to the plugin worker via `ADAPTER_ENV_PASSTHROUGH` (which 2026.609.0 limits to LLM keys — we extend it with a small anchored patch, `docker/patches/patch-paperclip-plugin-env.mjs`). This keeps secrets out of the plugin-config DB and mirrors how `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` already reaches adapters. Note: in stock 2026.609.0 the passthrough is gated on the `environment.drivers.register` capability. The env driver was **retired** (this plugin is now tools + jobs only, capability `agent.tools.register`), so the anchored patch widens the gate to also accept `agent.tools.register` — otherwise the tools-only worker would get no secrets. The same passthrough now also forwards the EVT keys (`EVT_API_URL/KEY/ACCOUNT_ID`) used by the bridge + the budget plugin, and `PAPERCLIP_API_URL/KEY/COMPANY_ID` used by the budget plugin's cron jobs.

The **GitHub token never touches disk or a URL**: a git credential helper reads it from `$GH_TOKEN` (set per-exec to the worker's `SANDBOX_GITHUB_TOKEN`) only for the single clone/fetch/push. Token scoping by role (`credMode`: read-only for verification, push for `sandbox_code_task`) is the target; for now a single fine-grained PAT (contents + PR rw) serves both, with separate read-only / push tokens — or a per-task **GitHub App** installation token — as production hardening.

## 6. Governance fit (Methods Officer loop)

This tool is the **execution primitive** under the existing self-evolution design ([methods-officer-self-evolution.md](./methods-officer-self-evolution.md)). Mapping:

- **Engineer** sub-agent: assigned an implementation issue, it **calls `sandbox_code_task`** (repo/branch/task), iterates by re-calling with the same `sandboxKey`, reviews its own diff via GitHub tools, and pushes a branch/PR — the **artifact the gates already expect**.
- **Acceptance-criteria controller / independent auditor** (different LLM): the **acceptance criteria become concrete commands** run via **`sandbox_run`** — `pnpm test`, `semgrep`, `trivy`, a functional/pentest suite — in its **own fresh sandbox at the pushed commit** (read-only creds). The exit codes + captured reports become **work-products (evidence)** attached to the issue, which the merge gate and the requester review. The auditor can also **read the diff via GitHub tools** — two independent angles, neither trusting the engineer's sandbox.
- Verification runs are **reproducible and isolated**: same commit + same command in a clean microVM → a result the gate can trust.

The Methods Officer governance (criticality registry, acceptance criteria, gates, production-ready registry) is unchanged; the _implementation step_ becomes "engineer calls `sandbox_code_task`", and **acceptance verification becomes "controllers call `sandbox_run`"** — both on the same isolated-sandbox primitive.

## 7. Risks / open questions

- **In-sandbox `claude` reliability over the SDK WS**: the agent run that streamed (GRA-15) completed; our reliable chunked transport ([#56]) handles bulk reads. A single bounded `claude -p` turn that pushes is far less demanding than Paperclip's full run+restore, so the `process_lost` watchdog issue does not apply (no external watcher). Still to validate end-to-end in the spike.
- **`claude` auth/config inside the Sprite**: confirmed working with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` passed via env (probe: `result: "PONG"`); the base image already ships the `claude` CLI.
- **Toolchain in the image** (`pnpm`, project deps): provision-on-first-use, or bake a custom Sprite image / checkpoint. Decide in the spike.
- **Cost guardrails**: per-call `timeoutMs`, a max-concurrent-Sprites cap, and the idle reaper.
- **Plugin tool execution limits**: confirm a Paperclip plugin tool can run for the minutes a real coding task takes (and stream/return a large summary) — the worker uses native WebSocket (Node 22), which behaved better than the polyfill in tests.

## 8. Build plan

0. **Spike — DONE (2026-06-21).** Standalone prototype validated end-to-end on `paperclip-poc`: create/reuse Sprite (cold→warm) → clone → `claude -p` (acceptEdits) edits → commit + **push from the sandbox** → re-invoke same Sprite → continue the branch → append → push. Verified on GitHub (two commits on `spike/sandbox-tool`). Git auth via credential helper, no token leak.
1. **`sandbox_run` primitive** as a Paperclip **plugin tool** (the general command exec at a git ref, `credMode`, artifact capture), reusing the reliable transport ([#55]/[#56]). Then **`sandbox_code_task`** as sugar (claude + git push) and **`sandbox_release`**.
2. **Lifecycle**: per-role `sandboxKey` reuse (warm/cold), `sandbox_release`, idle reaper, concurrency cap.
3. **Secure creds**: PAT from Secrets Manager, **scoped by `credMode`** (push vs read-only) → GitHub App token (production).
4. **Toolchain provisioning**: install what tasks/verifiers need (`pnpm`, scanners like `semgrep`/`trivy`, test deps) on first use, via a custom Sprite image, or a checkpoint of a tooled Sprite.
5. **Integrate** into the Methods Officer loop: engineer calls `sandbox_code_task`; acceptance/auditor controllers call `sandbox_run` (own sandbox at the pushed commit, read-only) and attach results as work-products.
6. **Retire** the sandbox _environment driver_ and the Paperclip retry-env patch ([#57]) once the tools supersede them; keep the reliable-transport helpers ([#55]/[#56]).

[#55]: stdin forwarding fix (merged)
[#56]: reliable large-output exec (merged)
[#57]: Paperclip retry-env patch (merged; to retire)
